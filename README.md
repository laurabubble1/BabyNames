# BabyNames
Mini Visualization Project

## To try out the code 

1. Clone the git repository on your computer : 
    - git clone https://github.com/laurabubble1/BabyNames.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Make sure you have python installed on your terminal.

3. python3 -m http.server 8000

4. Go to localhost:8000 to use the web interface.

## To use the interface

We have made a web interface to allow for easy manipulation compared to a simple Jupyter notebook.

### Visualization 1

You can visualize different names at the same time by separating them with a comma in the input field.

### Visualization 2

You can hover over a region for a bit to see how many babies with this name this region has declared.

### Visualization 3

Will be improved soon.
